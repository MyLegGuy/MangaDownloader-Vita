You need...

* Curl, OpenSSL.\n
	You can get these precompiled from [vdpm](https://github.com/vitasdk/vdpm).
* [Lua](https://www.lua.org/download.html).
	You will need to compile this yourself.
* [libvita2d](https://github.com/xerpi/libvita2d).
	Included in vdpm, I think. You can also compile it yourself easily.

After you get all the libraries you need, just run the `make` command.

**You need to put the contents of the folder VpkContents into the VPK manually!**
