Presented with main menu similar to 3ds Manga Reader.
Main function works the same
There are two download options.
"As I go" and "Wait."
"Wait" is what I've programmed so far.
	Select options, and then wait for it to download.
"As I go" will prompt you to enter the series and chapter, wait for the first page, and then send you right to the reader.
Via a second thread, more images will continue to download as you read.
(We'll start at 001.whatever and continue on incrementing by 1 because the filenames are predictable. Also, have a variable that says if we're finished downloading.)
	"As I go" may only support one chapter at a time.
